I met at the house today and after speaking with the insured, he explained that this situation was a big misunderstanding. Duane and Lori were not complaining about lack of communication between myself and them, for I have been in consistent contact with Duane almost everyday regarding updates and targets/scheduling. He was referring to lack of response from his insurance carrier/agent. Duane apologized for the mixup and and trouble he may have caused and I assured him that everything is good on my end. \n\nThe wood floors in the parlor room were completed today to Duane extreme satisfaction. The bathroom crew worked today on repairing drywall imperfections and repairing paneling. The crew will be back tomorrow to sand and paint these drywall areas. \nA plumber will be coming by as well to remove the toilet and flange so the subfloor can be corrected under the toilet. The floor repair will take place next week and all bathroom repairs should be completed by the 18th. \n\nDuring our walkthrough today, Duane noticed a different area in the parlor room where the drywall tapeline is visible and we discussed how to handle this. Unfortunately this was not noticed by anyone prior to the wood floors being finished. Duane would like to wait until next moth to repair this drywall so the floor stain and varnish has time to cure before we apply drop cloths to the floor for mud and paint. The flooring finisher advised to wait about&nbsp;&nbsp;a week although the insured requested to schedule this out later than that to make him more comfortable. I agreed and we will update when Duane and I agree to a date to repair those drywall areas.\n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to James.Cecil@contractorconnection.com; Mary.Thomas@ContractorConnection.com; Ron.Ruckel@wrginsurance.com",

I have a scheduled meeting with Duane at the house on Friday morning this week to discuss areas of concern and how to move forward. We are doing our best to provide laborers that can complete work to the insureds liking, although this project is far out from our usual territory and options are limited as to what contractors of ours will travel this far. \nThis was a discussion that was had with CC rep Arthur Hargrove Nov 1st - Nov 20th as you can see in notes 31-35, we were very upfront about lack of plumbers and carpenters/wood floor finishers we had that will operate in this area. Despite trying to cancel this assignment, Arthur told us we have to continue with completing the job because we wrote the estimate. We explained our concerns with taking this project on without the proper man power but our concerns were not heard by any parties. \n\nI have a crew meeting with me on Friday to talk with the insured and complete areas of touch up paint, and notate other areas of punchlist that need taken care of. I will update with running punchlist tomorrow. \n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to Mary.Thomas@ContractorConnection.com; Ron.Ruckel@wrginsurance.com; jason.odell@contractorconnection.com; sam.morales@contractorconnection.com; angelab@getdelmar.com; eddiej@getdelmar.com",

He spoke with the adjuster yesterday regarding the issues with the basement. \n\nThere is a small punchlist, although the insured had another, separate loss resulting in various damages to our completed work. He spoke with the adjuster regarding how to resolve this issue, and he stated the insured would have to either pay for things out of pocket or file another claim since this is a separate cause of loss. \nThe issue is that their ejector pump failed during heavy rains, damaging drywall, two recently replaced door jambs/slabs and is now beginning to mold. This was not due to the result of Del Mar or the work completed. \n\nThe punch list includes a cracked ceiling tile, (this was admittedly cracked by the insured who needed to get into the ceiling to access water shut off) although Brendan agreed to replace this for them, a thermostat that needs to be mounted, and there is a wire on the water meter that was allegedly cut during the work process. Brendan expressed to the owner that if he had the water company come out to repair, he would reimburse the invoice. \n\nIn the voicemail left for Brendan, there was mention of another cut wire for the phone lines/internet. This line was removed during the demo/install of drywall/wall panels and has since been reinstalled, although to our knowledge the line was not damaged or cut in any way. \n\nThe punchlist is minimal, although we would like to see how the owner would like to proceed with the resulting damages caused by the failed ejector pump, as to get these repairs done by one crew consecutively. \n\nIf you have any further questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to Brendan at 219-257-2477. \n\nThank you. \n\nBrendan Burns \nProject Manager \nDel Mar Builders\n15255 South 94th Ave. \nSuite 500\nOrland Park, IL 60462\nCell - 219-257-2477\n\n\nCyndi George\nSales Manager\nDel Mar Builders\nPh: 708-362-2628\nEmail: cyndig@getdelmar.com\n\nEmail sent to brendanb@getdelmar.com; eddiej@getdelmar.com; michak@getdelmar.com; ryand@getdelmar.com; mikeh@getdelmar.com",

Program instructions state that contractor should collect age and condition of materials estimated and document in XactAnalysis Notes. Please revise accordingly.&nbsp;&nbsp;DO NOT apply depreciation only document in XactAnalysis Notes\n\nBased on my inspection the installed materials are most likely 15+ years and the condition is comparative to the age. \n\n2. Program instructions state, adjuster should be contacted for estimates that will exceed $15,000 and a summary of the discussion including any agreements must be uploaded in Xactanalysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please provide required information\n\nI spoke with Jared, the SF adjuster assigned to this claim, at 10:50am CT to discuss the value and nature of this loss. \n\n3. Program instructions state the stair sketches must be placed in their correct location on the sketch, not outside of the floor plan sketch. Please revise accordingly\n\nREVISED \n\n4. Please revise the height of the fireplace to properly deduct\n\nThe fireplace is paneled and therefore not deducted in the sketch - The block placed in the sketch reflects the brick base of the fireplace and all required deductions have been made. \n\n5. Photos and/or documentation appear to support that footprint of lower cabinetry, tub, showers, etc. have not been deducted from flooring quantities. Please revise accordingly.\n6. Photos and/or documentation appear to support that the area of cabinetry/backsplash, tub/shower surrounds, etc. have not been deducted from wall painting/cleaning quantities. Please revise accordingly.\n\nFlooring continues under the vanity and bar areas and is documented in photos \n\n6. Photos and/or documentation appear to support that the area of cabinetry/backsplash, tub/shower surrounds, etc. have not been deducted from wall painting/cleaning quantities. Please revise accordingly.\n\nDrywall and paneling repairs are required behind these fixtures therefore Sq. Ft. of walls have not been deducted-&nbsp;&nbsp;Sq. Ft. behind bathroom vanity has been manually deducted and noted. \n\n7. Line 59 FNC CNR, Line 60 PNT CNRSP \u2013 The calculation appears incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please revise accordingly\n\nREVISED to cove molding at the ceiling perimeter - All calculations have been double checked according to field notes. \n\n8. CLN N-A, FCW MN-A - The&nbsp;&nbsp;labor minimum(s) has/have been applied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please clarify if it is necessary to have a separate skilled trade on site to perform the work triggering each labor minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;If another trade on site is capable of performing the work, please remove the minimum.\n\nAll labor minimums have been REMOVED \n\nThank you, \n\nDean P.

                "note": "Good evening, \n \n The insured is aware that the 2 additional coats of paint are not approved by the insurance policy, this is OOP change order the insured added before job start. The insured is expecting for a paint job to including extensive prep work to old and worn paneling and expects the paneling to look new when we are done. We tried to manage expectation regarding the paneling painting, an tat there is no way to prep and repair paneling that has these kinds of impurities and made to look new side from replacing the paneling. \n \n When talks between the insured and the PM Jason Brendl were underway regarding scheduling the kitchen floor refinishing, the insured mentioned a range of dates that shew was already going to be out of town and asked if we could schedule the floor refinish during this time. We did not request that she need to be out of the house during these repairs. the flooring repairs do not inhibit the customers from entering their home our allowing them access to the second floor of the home where the office and bedrooms, as well as a bathroom are located. The floors started Tuesday the 2nd, during the time the insured was out of town, and the floors were completed Friday late morning, and the insured came back into town Friday evening. The only request that was made was that the insured stay off the floors Friday night an wait until Saturday to walk into the kitchen. Sunday afternoon, the insured texted Jason relaying that she was not satisfied with the floor refinish work, and that she would like for someone to come by and have a look. Jason let the insured know that he would be stopping by Monday afternoon to check on the crew and take a look at the floors. When Jason arrived, the crew was working and the insured entered the home, and said that she cannot talk and needed to make a phone call, and would not be available to have a conversation with Jason until 430PM. Understandably, Jason was not in a position to wait 3 hours for the insured to be available, although the crew had already been working on touching up the areas that the insured did not like. \n \n On Tuesday the 9th, The insured was using the basement for her office space working, and our foreman asked when she would be finished with work so the drywall crew can get down there and start on drywall repairs. The insured asked how long the crew would need, because it will be difficult to move her space that night because \"every other room in the house is not usable\". this seemed unreasonable because there are three bedrooms, a living room, and an office in the basement that is usable, where no work is being completed. the insured then asked if they can start around 2. Our foreman asked if they could start down there at around 330PM instead, and that the crew would need a few hours to finish drywall and tape, so that it could dry overnight and be ready for additional coats of mud (if needed) or ready to sand by Wednesday morning. The insured responded saying \"okay, thanks then you can start drywall at 5PM tonight.\" \n \n If needed, we have documented text correspondence between our foreman Tammy and the insured, as well as separate texts with our PM Jason regarding this situation that we can provide. We are doing our best the work with the insured, we understand that any construction taking place in a residence can be inconvenient and stressful.. however our crews need to be able to access these areas, and be allowed to complete work tasks without constant micromanagement and complaints. Any workmanships issues will be addressed, although some of the complaints are about work that has not been completed or considered the \"finished product.\" \n \n At this time, Jason has elected to remove the current crew and replace with new faces to hopefully salvage the situation.\n \n Brendan Burns\n Del Mar Builders \n Estimator \n 219-257-2477&lt;",

The adjuster met out there with me and made changes to the estimate and sent me the ESX file and a report of his findings/changes. I uploaded is ESX and sent his estimate in. Is the adjusters reinspection estimate not what we should be working off of? Based on the field adjuster and I's conversation on site, he was there to verify damages and made adjustments to the estimate as needed.. \n So when I get review notes back from a field adjusters estimate, those review notes need to be made, and it doesn't matter what the field adjuster wrote? Because again, the last estimate I uploaded was a copy paste of your adjusters estimate which is why I ignored MICA reports.\n \n Can you please give me a call to clarify this process for better success in the future?

Mitigation has not started yet and are delayed due to asbestos testing. \nThe city is also supposed to come out and dig a 6x6 by 4ft deep area in the basement to repair the line that is causing the water damage. Due to this, I am unable to provide an accurate and complete scope of work. I am unsure what the extent of the repairs will be once the city comes in to complete their scope. Please advise if you would like for me to upload a preliminary estimate, or wait until the city has completed the dig and mitigation has completed so a complete scope can be provided. \n\nThank you!\n\n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to eddiej@getdelmar.com; angelab@getdelmar.com",

However, due to inclement weather this week, the job has fallen a bit behind schedule.\n \n In addition, we have encountered a complication with the insured's cracked sewer line, which has caused sewage to back up in his basement. As a precaution, we have camera'd the lines yesterday to determine the cause and have taken measures to mitigate the sewage from further damage. We are currently working with the insured to determine the cost of the repairs so that the issue does not persist.\n \n Please note that this is a pre-existing damage and is not related to the fire in any way. We are doing our best to resolve the issue in a timely and efficient manner.\n \n Once the concrete porch is completed, team will finish the rest of the facia soffit and everything will be completed. However, I would like to remind you that these additional costs will not be covered as the insured has exceeded his coverage limits.\n \n I will post photos of the completed porch and the broken sewer line for your records shortly.\n \n Thank you!\n \n Angela P.

We had initially planned to frame a wooden deck, but upon further inspection, we have found that the damages are too severe. Therefore, in the interest of safety, we have decided to install a new concrete porch at no additional cost to the insured. Please note that this was not a part of the initial loss, but we believe it is necessary to ensure the safety of the property.\n\nLastly, I would like to inform you that the home is currently in a state of disarray. We have found feces throughout the house and the basement has also experienced a sewer backup. We are currently assisting Mr. Sanders with this issue and have started the process of cameraing the existing line to identify the problem.\n\nI will provide an additional update on Friday regarding the progress at the property. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns just let us know and also keep in mind that none of these costs are being covered by the insurance loss and he well exceeded his policy limits.\n\nThank you!\n\nAngela P.
