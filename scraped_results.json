Mitigation has not started yet and are delayed due to asbestos testing. \nThe city is also supposed to come out and dig a 6x6 by 4ft deep area in the basement to repair the line that is causing the water damage.

I met at the house today and after speaking with the insured, he explained that this situation was a big misunderstanding. Duane and Lori were not complaining about lack of communication between myself and them, for I have been in consistent contact with Duane almost everyday regarding updates and targets/scheduling. He was referring to lack of response from his insurance carrier/agent. Duane apologized for the mixup and and trouble he may have caused and I assured him that everything is good on my end. \n\nThe wood floors in the parlor room were completed today to Duane extreme satisfaction. The bathroom crew worked today on repairing drywall imperfections and repairing paneling. The crew will be back tomorrow to sand and paint these drywall areas. \nA plumber will be coming by as well to remove the toilet and flange so the subfloor can be corrected under the toilet. The floor repair will take place next week and all bathroom repairs should be completed by the 18th. \n\nDuring our walkthrough today, Duane noticed a different area in the parlor room where the drywall tapeline is visible and we discussed how to handle this. Unfortunately this was not noticed by anyone prior to the wood floors being finished. Duane would like to wait until next moth to repair this drywall so the floor stain and varnish has time to cure before we apply drop cloths to the floor for mud and paint. The flooring finisher advised to wait about&nbsp;&nbsp;a week although the insured requested to schedule this out later than that to make him more comfortable.

I have a scheduled meeting with Duane at the house on Friday morning this week to discuss areas of concern and how to move forward. We are doing our best to provide laborers that can complete work to the insureds liking, although this project is far out from our usual territory and options are limited as to what contractors of ours will travel this far. \nThis was a discussion that was had with CC rep Arthur Hargrove Nov 1st - Nov 20th as you can see in notes 31-35, we were very upfront about lack of plumbers and carpenters/wood floor finishers we had that will operate in this area. Despite trying to cancel this assignment, Arthur told us we have to continue with completing the job because we wrote the estimate. We explained our concerns with taking this project on without the proper man power but our concerns were not heard by any parties. \n\nI have a crew meeting with me on Friday to talk with the insured and complete areas of touch up paint, and notate other areas of punchlist that need taken care of. I will update with running punchlist tomorrow. \n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to Mary.Thomas@ContractorConnection.com; Ron.Ruckel@wrginsurance.com; jason.odell@contractorconnection.com; sam.morales@contractorconnection.com; angelab@getdelmar.com; eddiej@getdelmar.com",

Please provide required information.\n \n 2) 23. DRY ACARMV- Program instructions require that the adjuster be notified of the possible hazardous materials (i.e. Mold, Asbestos, Lead). Please update XactAnalysis notes with the full name of the adjuster who was notified as well as the date and time.\n \n 3) 23. DRY ACARMV &amp; 26. DRY AC+ are overlapping as both are for removal. \n \n 4) MSD MN-A, WDT MN-A, LAB LBRMN-A labor minimum should be turned off as common industry practice is for this work to be completed by another trade onsite. Please revise accordingly.\n \n 5) 7 &amp; 24. DRY \u00bd Estimate reflects drywall replacement finished ready for paint. As texture will be applied on the drywall, please revise to drywall ready for texture.\n \n 6) Program instructions require the sketch to include accurate measurements for walls, multiple ceiling heights, offsets, missing walls, windows, cabinets, vanities, tubs, tile surrounds, showers and similar items. Please provide an accurate sketch using Xactimate. ***Please deduct openings***\n \n 7) 43. PLM TSFAURS- Photos do not appear to show a need to detach the valve and shower head assembly behind the wall. Only the finish trim would need to be detached. Please revise PLM TSFAURS to PLM TSFFTRS.\n \n \n Jason O'Dell- Contractor Connection\n Estimate Review\n 1(904) 513-7338\n jason.odell@contractorconnection.com Email sent to presleyd@getdelmar.com; mikeh@getdelmar.com; jasonb@getdelmar.com; justicej@getdelmar.com; michellec@getdelmar.com; eddiej@getdelmar.com; brendanb@getdelmar.com; cyndig@getdelmar.com; lindsayh@getdelmar.com; RyanD@getdelmar.com; micahk@getdelmar.com; deang@getdelmar.com; delmarbuilders@yahoo.com",

The adjuster met out there with me and made changes to the estimate and sent me the ESX file and a report of his findings/changes. I uploaded is ESX and sent his estimate in. Is the adjusters reinspection estimate not what we should be working off of? Based on the field adjuster and I's conversation on site, he was there to verify damages and made adjustments to the estimate as needed.. \n So when I get review notes back from a field adjusters estimate, those review notes need to be made, and it doesn't matter what the field adjuster wrote? Because again, the last estimate I uploaded was a copy paste of your adjusters estimate which is why I ignored MICA reports.\n \n Can you please give me a call to clarify this process for better success in the future?

When he arrived, the insured was able to let him in but not able to speak as she was tied up in meetings. He returned again yesterday to apply a 4th top coat to the floor. Per our hardwood floor specialist, there is not much more he can do to get the floor looking any better than it does after the 4th coat. We feel that the expectation of the insured is the floor are to look perfect when we are finished, although hand finished hardwood floors rarely have zero impurities due to the imperfect nature of wood. Jason, our hardwood floor specialist is the best we have and we have had no issues with any of his work in the past. If the floor is still seen as unacceptable, we would like to request a field representative meet us at the property to review the work in hopes of coming to a resolution as soon as possible.\n\nAs for the cabinets, we have communicated with the insured that we will repair the cabinet toe kick when the hardwood floor work is approved. Our floor specialist had to tape of the toe kick and side panels to avoid getting stain or varnish on the cabinets, and unfortunately the tape took a small section of paint of the toe kick. We have agreed to fix this once we are completed with the floor, and the insured passes the floor. \n\nWhen the floor is approved we have our drywall/painter on call to go back and finish paint of trims, repair toe kick, and we can also take a look at the door to see if anything else can be done to clean rather than replace. Although as previously stated, we cannot send another crew to the property to complete this until the floor is signed off on. \n\nPM Jason Brendle will be reaching out to the insured tomorrow to discuss the floor and see how they feel about the work that has been completed to the floor.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out directly to myself, or PM Jason Brendle at 773-307-2737, as we would be more than happy to answer any additional questions you might have. \n\nThank you.\n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to Joanna.Milton@ContractorConnection.com; monique.ford@usaa.com; angelab@getdelmar.com; jasonb@getdelmar.com; mikeh@getdelmar.com",

                "note": "Good evening, \n \n The insured is aware that the 2 additional coats of paint are not approved by the insurance policy, this is OOP change order the insured added before job start. The insured is expecting for a paint job to including extensive prep work to old and worn paneling and expects the paneling to look new when we are done. We tried to manage expectation regarding the paneling painting, an tat there is no way to prep and repair paneling that has these kinds of impurities and made to look new side from replacing the paneling. \n \n When talks between the insured and the PM Jason Brendl were underway regarding scheduling the kitchen floor refinishing, the insured mentioned a range of dates that shew was already going to be out of town and asked if we could schedule the floor refinish during this time. We did not request that she need to be out of the house during these repairs. the flooring repairs do not inhibit the customers from entering their home our allowing them access to the second floor of the home where the office and bedrooms, as well as a bathroom are located. The floors started Tuesday the 2nd, during the time the insured was out of town, and the floors were completed Friday late morning, and the insured came back into town Friday evening. The only request that was made was that the insured stay off the floors Friday night an wait until Saturday to walk into the kitchen. Sunday afternoon, the insured texted Jason relaying that she was not satisfied with the floor refinish work, and that she would like for someone to come by and have a look. Jason let the insured know that he would be stopping by Monday afternoon to check on the crew and take a look at the floors. When Jason arrived, the crew was working and the insured entered the home, and said that she cannot talk and needed to make a phone call, and would not be available to have a conversation with Jason until 430PM. Understandably, Jason was not in a position to wait 3 hours for the insured to be available, although the crew had already been working on touching up the areas that the insured did not like. \n \n On Tuesday the 9th, The insured was using the basement for her office space working, and our foreman asked when she would be finished with work so the drywall crew can get down there and start on drywall repairs. The insured asked how long the crew would need, because it will be difficult to move her space that night because \"every other room in the house is not usable\". this seemed unreasonable because there are three bedrooms, a living room, and an office in the basement that is usable, where no work is being completed. the insured then asked if they can start around 2. Our foreman asked if they could start down there at around 330PM instead, and that the crew would need a few hours to finish drywall and tape, so that it could dry overnight and be ready for additional coats of mud (if needed) or ready to sand by Wednesday morning. The insured responded saying \"okay, thanks then you can start drywall at 5PM tonight.\" \n \n If needed, we have documented text correspondence between our foreman Tammy and the insured, as well as separate texts with our PM Jason regarding this situation that we can provide. We are doing our best the work with the insured, we understand that any construction taking place in a residence can be inconvenient and stressful.. however our crews need to be able to access these areas, and be allowed to complete work tasks without constant micromanagement and complaints. Any workmanships issues will be addressed, although some of the complaints are about work that has not been completed or considered the \"finished product.\" \n \n At this time, Jason has elected to remove the current crew and replace with new faces to hopefully salvage the situation.\n \n Brendan Burns\n Del Mar Builders \n Estimator \n 219-257-2477&lt;",

However, due to inclement weather this week, the job has fallen a bit behind schedule.\n \n In addition, we have encountered a complication with the insured's cracked sewer line, which has caused sewage to back up in his basement. As a precaution, we have camera'd the lines yesterday to determine the cause and have taken measures to mitigate the sewage from further damage. We are currently working with the insured to determine the cost of the repairs so that the issue does not persist.\n \n Please note that this is a pre-existing damage and is not related to the fire in any way. We are doing our best to resolve the issue in a timely and efficient manner.\n \n Once the concrete porch is completed, team will finish the rest of the facia soffit and everything will be completed. However, I would like to remind you that these additional costs will not be covered as the insured has exceeded his coverage limits.\n \n I will post photos of the completed porch and the broken sewer line for your records shortly.\n \n Thank you!\n \n Angela P.

We had initially planned to frame a wooden deck, but upon further inspection, we have found that the damages are too severe. Therefore, in the interest of safety, we have decided to install a new concrete porch at no additional cost to the insured. Please note that this was not a part of the initial loss, but we believe it is necessary to ensure the safety of the property.\n\nLastly, I would like to inform you that the home is currently in a state of disarray. We have found feces throughout the house and the basement has also experienced a sewer backup. We are currently assisting Mr. Sanders with this issue and have started the process of cameraing the existing line to identify the problem.\n\nI will provide an additional update on Friday regarding the progress at the property. In the meantime, if you have any questions or concerns just let us know and also keep in mind that none of these costs are being covered by the insurance loss and he well exceeded his policy limits.\n\nThank you!\n\nAngela P.

He proceeded to yell at Angela in our front office explaining that we never sent him an estimate and that we are unprofessional. \nWhen I met the insured for the inspection, he had asked if I could send him the estimate I was uploading and I explained that typically per policy we are unable to send estimates until we get either an approval, or denied claim. This is to mitigate confusion for sometimes these estimates go though a couple rounds of revisions before a final estimate is approved. For this reason, he feels we are trying to pull one over on him.. \n\nDuring this inspection he had also mentioned that he had filed a claim on this roof once before, but the contractor&nbsp;&nbsp;took the money and either did not fully complete the repairs, or did a poor job, and the contractor disappeared. I told him that I would send a full roof replacement estimate in because based on the damages that is what is needed, although if State Farm has paid for these damages once before and the repairs they covered were not completed, it is possible they wont pay out again. I explained that ultimately, coverage decisions are up to State Farm, for I am just the messenger/reporter of damages. He stated today that my comments regarding this were negative and he does not want us to complete the work. \n \nCan we please cancel this assignment? \n\nThank you! \n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to shilo.rash@sedgwickrepair.com; eddiej@getdelmar.com; angelab@getdelmar.com",
